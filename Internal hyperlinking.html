    <p>HTML is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage using different tags. Without HTML, websites would not be able to display content properly.</p>
    <p>HTML uses various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Each element has a specific purpose in organizing content. Tags must be opened and closed correctly to avoid errors.</p>
    
    <h2 id="bb">Chapter 2</h2><br>

    <p>With HTML, developers can define the layout of a webpage before styling it with CSS. It helps browsers understand how to display text, tables, forms, and multimedia. Every website on the internet begins with basic HTML structure.</p>
    <p>Hyperlinks in HTML allow users to navigate from one page to another easily. They can connect webpages within the same website or to external sites. Using the target attribute, links can open in new tabs or frames.</p>
    
    <h2 id="cc">Chapter 3</h2><br>
    <p>he latest version of HTML is HTML5, which supports modern web features. It includes elements for audio, video, graphics, and responsive design. HTML5 makes websites more interactive and user-friendly</p>

    <p>HTML works together with CSS and JavaScript to create complete websites. While HTML builds the structure, CSS adds design and style, and JavaScript makes pages interactive. All three are essential for modern web development.</p>
